# Highlight Elements is a chrome extension for rapid web page prototyping.
# When you deploy the extension, it will put a randomly colored border around every HTMLElement within the page's DOM.
# Additionally, the extension will display a legend in a popup window with information on each element.
# We hope that it is useful in your front end styling journey!
# Happy prototyping!!
